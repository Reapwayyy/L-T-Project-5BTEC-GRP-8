Smart City Monitoring System â€“ Cisco Packet Tracer

ðŸ”¹ Aim
To design and simulate an intelligent urban environment using Cisco Packet Tracer that integrates smart surveillance, intelligent street lighting, and fire monitoring systems for efficient city management and improved safety.

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement
Modern cities face challenges in managing public safety, energy consumption, and emergency response.
Traditional systems are reactive, inefficient, and often lack real-time monitoring. There is a need for a smart urban solution that combines IoT-based automation and monitoring for:
â€¢	Preventing fire hazards with quick suppression
â€¢	Reducing electricity wastage via intelligent street lighting
â€¢	Enhancing comfort and safety in smart homes
This project addresses these issues by simulating a Smart City ecosystem with three key components:
1.	Smart Fire Suppression System
2.	Smart Street Lighting System
3.	Smart Home Monitoring System
________________________________________
ðŸ”¹ Scope of the Solution
The proposed system enables:
â€¢	Automatic fire detection & suppression using IoT sensors (flame sensor) and actuators (sprinklers/alarms).
â€¢	Intelligent energy-saving street lights that turn ON/OFF or dim based on time and motion sensors.
â€¢	Smart home automation for controlling appliances, monitoring entry points, and enhancing security.
The scope is limited to simulation in Cisco Packet Tracer but can be extended to real-time IoT implementations using ESP32/Arduino with IoT platforms like Blynk, Node-RED, or ThingsBoard.
